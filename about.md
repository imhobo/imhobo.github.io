Hi, I am Safal.  

I was brought up in Delhi and currently working in Bangalore. I am a Software Engineer by day and an armchair philosopher by night.  

I love all competitive sports and games notably Cricket, Badminton, Dota and chess. 

I also spend considerable amount of time just thinking. I wish I could use some of that time to do something meaningful that could make some money for God's sake.

Federer over Nadal/Djokovic  
Vim over Emacs  
Beaches over Mountains
