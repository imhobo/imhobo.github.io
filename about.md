_Somewhere in Goa_


Hi, I am Safal.  

I was brought up in Delhi and currently working in Bangalore. I am a Software Engineer by day and an armchair philosopher by night.  

I love all competitive sports and games notably Badminton, Chess, Cricket and DotA. 

I also spend considerable amount of time just thinking. I wish I could use some of that time to do something meaningful that could make some money for God's sake.

> Beaches over Mountains
